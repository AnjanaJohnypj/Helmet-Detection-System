# Helmet-Detection-System
Its a simple YOLO model for automatic detection of bike-riders who fail to wear a safety helmet and also adding a license plate detector to send immediate penalties to those who are violating the rules.

The steps includes:

1.Data Acquisition.

2.Data Preparation according to the yolo.

3.Load Dataset.

4.Train the dataset.

5.Obtain the model weights.

6.Test the model.

## The system consists of four phases:-

 Vehicle Classification
